Brill passed away on March 27, 2013, after complications due to breast cancer. The obituary the <i>New York Times</i> was originally to publish began "She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job and took eight years off from work to raise three children." This was heavily criticized as an overemphasis on family life and a diminishment of her scientific career. Ultimately, the <i>Times</i> changed the introduction of the obituary by removing the reference to her cooking.
